# RearingRanch
Rearing Ranch is a small game my partner Tamir Arnesty and I, Inal Gotov, are 
developing for our final project in our Grade 12 AP Computer Science class. It will be an educational
game for children between the ages of 3 to 5, which will teach them basic colors, classification of 
animals, as well as simple arithmetic.

The game is in a farming theme where you must help a young cowboy manage his farm.
